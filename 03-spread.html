</div>


<p>This is a lesson on tidying/untidying data, remixed from <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy">Jenny Bryan‚Äôs similar lesson using ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù data</a>. Most text + code is Jenny‚Äôs, basically we plopped a new dataset in there üòâ</p>
<hr />
<p>Enough about tidy data. How do I make it messy?</p>
<p>Regardless of which <code>gather</code>ing adventure you embarked upon, we‚Äôll all use the Bachelor/Bachelorette data from <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bachelorette">538</a> to practice spreading.</p>
<div id="import-tidy" class="section level1">

<p>What do those mean? Here is a key:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúE‚Äù connotes a standard elimination, typically at a rose ceremony.</li>
<li>‚ÄúEQ‚Äù means the contestant quits.</li>
<li>‚ÄúEF‚Äù means the contestant was fired by production.</li>
<li>‚ÄúED‚Äù connotes a date elimination.</li>
<li>‚ÄúEU‚Äù connotes an unscheduled elimination, one that takes place at a time outside of a date or rose ceremony.</li>
<li>‚ÄúR‚Äù means the contestant received a rose.</li>
<li>‚ÄúR1‚Äù means the contestant got a first impression rose.</li>

<div id="spread" class="section level1">
