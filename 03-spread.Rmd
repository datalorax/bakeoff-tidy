This is a lesson on tidying/untidying data, remixed from [Jenny Bryan's similar lesson using "Lord of the Rings" data](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy). Most text + code is Jenny's, basically we plopped a new dataset in there `r emo::ji("wink")`

---

```{r setup, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE, collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(DT)
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal())
```

Enough about tidy data. How do I make it messy?

Regardless of which `gather`ing adventure you embarked upon, we'll all use the Bachelor/Bachelorette data from [538](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bachelorette) to practice spreading.

# Import & Tidy

Use the following code to read in and tidy the data (Note: you'll get a bunch of parsing errors and that is OK to ignore):

```{r results='hide'}
# load package
library(tidyverse)

# import and tidy
b_tidy <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/bachelorette/bachelorette.csv",
                         col_types = cols(SEASON = col_integer())) %>% 
  filter(!SEASON == "SEASON") %>% 
  select(SHOW, SEASON, CONTESTANT, starts_with("ELIMINATION")) %>% 
  gather(key = "week", value = "eliminated", starts_with("ELIMINATION"), na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(week = str_replace(week, "-", "_"),
         week = parse_number(week))

```

# Explore

What are the possible values in the new `eliminated` column? (hint: `distinct` possible values)

```{r echo = FALSE}
# what are the distinct values in this column?
b_tidy %>% 
  distinct(eliminated)

```

What do those mean? Here is a key:

- "E" connotes a standard elimination, typically at a rose ceremony. 
- "EQ" means the contestant quits. 
- "EF" means the contestant was fired by production. 
- "ED" connotes a date elimination. 
- "EU" connotes an unscheduled elimination, one that takes place at a time outside of a date or rose ceremony.
- "R" means the contestant received a rose. 
- "R1" means the contestant got a first impression rose.
- "W" means the contestant won.



# Count 

Using that tidy data, `count` the values in your new `eliminated` column by contestant name and show.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# count eliminated by contestant name and show
b_counts <- b_tidy %>% 
  count(CONTESTANT, SHOW, eliminated)
b_counts

```

Again, we can squint hard at this `r nrow(b_counts)` row tibble, but if we want to look at numbers like this:

![](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/koeze-hickey-bachelor-3-update.png)

We need to reshape this data (again).

# Spread

Let's `spread` that counted data, so that we get a column for each possible value in the `eliminated` column, and those columns hold the values in the `n` column. Set `fill` to 0.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# spread eliminated counts
first_impressions <- b_counts %>% 
  spread(eliminated, n, fill = 0) 

# make interactive table to explore
datatable(first_impressions)
```


# Plot


Make a facetted bar plot with this data to show how many winning/losing contestants (hint: `geom_col()` might be a good choice here) in each show got first impression roses.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# make facetted bar chart
ggplot(first_impressions, aes(x = as.factor(W), y = R1)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~SHOW) +
  labs(x = "0 = Lost, 1 = Won", y = "Contestants receiving first impression roses")

```



# Bonus material

Calculate percentages of contestants in each show to answer what percentage of contestants that got a first impression rose were not winners?

```{r}
# use tidy data to calculate percentages
(bummers <- first_impressions %>% 
  count(SHOW, R1, W) %>% 
  add_count(SHOW, R1, wt = n) %>% 
  mutate(perc = n/nn * 100))

```

Answers: Only `r bummers %>% filter(SHOW == "Bachelor", R1 == 1, W == 1) %>% pull(perc) %>% round(2)` % of Bachelor contestants who got a first impression rose won. Bachelorette contestants were a little better off: `r bummers %>% filter(SHOW == "Bachelorette", R1 == 1, W == 1) %>% pull(perc) %>% round(2)` % who got a first impression rose won.

```{r}
# plot percentages
ggplot(first_impressions, aes(x = as.factor(SHOW), y = R1, fill = as.factor(W))) +
  geom_col(position = "fill")

```


# Code Appendix

```{r ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo = T, eval = F}
```
